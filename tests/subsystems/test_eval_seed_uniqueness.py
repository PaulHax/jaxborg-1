"""Regression test: eval episode seeds must produce unique CybORG envs.

History: the old eval scheme used ``cyborg_bank_seed_from_seed(seed + ep*100,
bank_match_size=32)`` which mapped 30 episodes to only 8 unique CybORG seeds
via the topology bank's ``mod bank_size`` indexing.  After the bank was
retired, ``make_cyborg_env`` takes raw ``seed`` and the dev parity rollout
loops pass ``seed + ep``.

This test pins that the seeding pattern produces distinct seeds across the
30-episode default eval horizon.  A future regression to ``seed * 100``-style
indexing would be caught here.
