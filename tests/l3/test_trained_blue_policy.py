"""L3 test: run a JAXborg-trained IPPO policy through the differential harness.

A trained policy exercises realistic blue action sequences (monitor → detect →
remove → restore) that random blue never would. This catches bugs in specific
action combinations that matter for training and transfer.

The policy observes JAX state (via get_blue_obs), computes action masks, runs
inference, and feeds the chosen actions to BOTH CybORG and JAX via the harness.
Any state divergence is a real bug.
